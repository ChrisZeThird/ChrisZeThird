- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ChrisZeThird
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m studying fundamental Physics, but I also love Computer Science, Biology and Art
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning many things, and I love it

My aspiration is to become a Physicist, specialised in Eletromagnetism and Quantum Mechanic, and work on the Physical Applications of those fields of research in Biology and Medicine. Naturally, in order to achieve that goal, it is necessary to have a solid Mathematics AND Programming background. So here I am learning Python.
